### Current TODO
- Revamp event system
- Gather resources into inventory
    + Requires creating resource entities and gathering certain resources if you ahve a tool
- Enemy combat
    + Need to make enemies
    + need to make weapons
    + need to deal and take damage, and die
- Crafting
    + make different weapons
    + make different tools
- Get RNG working for combat and gathering etc...
- Procedural generation


### Event System Revamp
- Scalable
- ABle to just define a struct of the information for the event
- Able to register consumer and producer
- Don't have the rewrite an entire event thing
- Probably use anytype and anyopaque and use "interfaces"
